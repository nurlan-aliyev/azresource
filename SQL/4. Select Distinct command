The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

SELECT DISTINCT Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
Demo Database
Below is a selection from the "Customers" table in the Northwind sample database:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country
1

Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Obere Str. 57	Berlin	12209	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Avda. de la Constitución 2222	México D.F.	05021	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mataderos 2312	México D.F.	05023	Mexico
4

Around the Horn	Thomas Hardy	120 Hanover Sq.	London	WA1 1DP	UK
5	Berglunds snabbköp	Christina Berglund	Berguvsvägen 8	Luleå	S-958 22	Sweden
SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
The following SQL statement selects all (including the duplicates) values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

Example
SELECT Country FROM Customers;
Now, let us use the SELECT DISTINCT statement and see the result.

SELECT DISTINCT Examples
The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

Example
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:

Example
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
Note: The example above will not work in Firefox! Because COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases. Firefox is using Microsoft Access in our examples.

Here is the workaround for MS Access:

Example
SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
